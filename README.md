# Machine Learning Algorithms: SVM, KNN, Softmax, and Two-Layer Neural Network

This repository contains Python implementations of classic machine-learning algorithms for educational and practice purposes. The goal is to showcase basic models and their implementation from scratch, helping to understand their mechanics and use cases better.

## Algorithms Implemented

1. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
   A powerful classification algorithm that finds the hyperplane that best separates classes in the feature space.

2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
   A simple, instance-based learning algorithm that classifies data points based on the majority class of their nearest neighbors.

3. **Softmax Regression**  
   A classification algorithm that generalizes logistic regression to multi-class problems, is often used as the output layer in neural networks.

4. **Two-Layer Neural Network**  
   A basic implementation of a neural network with one hidden layer, using a sigmoid activation function for both the secret and output layers.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualizations, if included in your code)
- Scikit-learn (for datasets and additional utilities, if included)

You can install the necessary dependencies using `pip`:

pip install -r requirements.txt:
